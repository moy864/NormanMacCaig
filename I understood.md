[[Assisi]] [[Norman MacCaig]]

The [[enjambment]] of "I understood/ the explanation and/ the cleverness" reveals the poet's cycnical outlook towards the church: he belives that it is hypocritical for preaching the works of saints such as St Francis and Giotto, yet not practise these principles through ignoring the poverty and suffering around them.
