 [[Aunt Julia]][[Norman MacCaig]]
 - "she was buckets/ and water flouncing out of them"
 This use of [[synechdoche]] and [[transferred epiphet]] defines Aunt Julia as buckets of water thus suggesting that she is in constant motion. This therefore emphasises the pace of her busy life. It also connotes that these tasks were a big part of her life.
