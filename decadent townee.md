[[Norman MacCaig]] [[Basking Shark]]
The [[self deprecating]] tone used in "decadent townee" suggests a person who has distanced themselves from their 'roots' and also who lives for the sole purpose of gratification and luxury. This is far from the forager roots that the human race originated from.  The poet has came to a stark realisation and has been literally shaken by the shark.
