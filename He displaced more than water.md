[[Norman MacCaig]] [[Basking Shark]]
The shark's movements have caused the water to move violently, shifting the poet and his boat from their original position. However, the poet is also saying that the shark has caused him to question his position in the evolutionary process. Before meeting the shark, the poet seems to be quite content with his place in the order of things but now he is removed from that position, forced to reassess his views. The word "displaced" could also suggest the poet's discomfort at being forced to think that he might be nearer the shark on the ladder of evolution than he likes to ac knowledge.
