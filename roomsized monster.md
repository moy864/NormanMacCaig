[[Norman MacCaig]] [[Basking Shark]]
The [[Word choice]]"roomsized" emphasises the sheer size and bulk of the shark. The word "monster" also places the shark very low down in the evolutionary scale; it is reminiscent of dinosaurs which existed millions of years ago. All this serves to demonstate how basic and underdeveloped the shark is; an idea continued by "matchbox brain"
