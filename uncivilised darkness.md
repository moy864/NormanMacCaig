- "uncivilised darkness/ is shot at by a million lit windows" connotes a barbaric and violent environment. Furthermore "shot at" links to the wild west and its anarchy
- [[Word choice]] "uncivilised" suggests uncouth and primative. This therefore emphasises the ominous nature of the darkness and the violence it brings with it
